# UTF8 Validator (C edition)

This is a more basic but faster version of [UTF8 Validator](https://github.com/digital-preservation/utf8-validator). The C edition, uses the [fastvalidate-utf-8](https://github.com/lemire/fastvalidate-utf-8) library from [Daniel Lemire](https://github.com/lemire). The C edition only returns a pass or fail result. It does not provide information about the position at which validation fails or allow to continue validating further after the first error.

A UTF-8 Validation Tool which may be used as a command line tool, if you are looking for a C library to use with your own program see [fastvalidate-utf-8](https://github.com/lemire/fastvalidate-utf-8).
